1. Code Analysis for Animal Class
Seems like the developer is trying to do method overriding for which the same method signature should be used and not the overloading that is done here.


2. Code Analysis for A class
Based on what the user is trying to implement here are some of the apparent problems

1. a is not instantiated and the user is trying to assign value to the property of a
2. const is a compile-time assignment and we need to assign value that can be accessed during compile time for that
3. Syntax for Console Writeline is also incorrect
